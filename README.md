# Bug-Tracker

Bug Tracker is a full stack application built with JavaScript and Python to help teams manage multiple software projects. It acts as a central place for developers to submit tickets for bugs and errors found within their applications, or to request features. Regular users can submit tickets, view their projects, and comment on/update tickets. Admin users can assign developers to projects, manage users, and update ticket info (such as priority/status).
  
The live version of the project can be found [here](https://bug-ticket-tracker.netlify.app/).

The repository for the REST API backend can be found [here](https://github.com/Justin-Cordero/bug-tracker-backend).

## Technologies Used

JSON Web Tokens were used for user authentication.  
[GitHub Users API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/users) was used to grab user info to add to their profile page.  
[QuickChart.io](https://quickchart.io/) was used to dynamically generate charts used to visualize data about the active software projects and tickets.
